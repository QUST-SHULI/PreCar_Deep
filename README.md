###Guiding principles:

**The dataset file contains four categories  datasets, which contain training datasets and independent test datasets.


**Feature coding：

AAC.py is the implementation of AAC.

AAindex.py is the implementation of AAindex.

CTriad.py is the implementation of implement CT.

DC.py is the implementation of DC.

EGAAC.py is the implementation of EGAAC.

KNN.py is the implementation of KNN.


**Feature selection:

group lasso.py is the implementation of Group LASSO.

**Balancing stage:

bupingheng_j.py is the implementation of Borderline-SMOTE.


**Classifier:

CBLM.py is the implementation of CBLM.
